# 🪨 Rock vs Mine Prediction Web App

This project is a **Machine Learning–based Rock vs Mine Classification System**
built using **Scikit-learn** and deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application**.

The model predicts whether an object detected by SONAR signals is a **Rock** or a **Mine**.
